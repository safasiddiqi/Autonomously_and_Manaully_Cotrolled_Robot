# Autonomously_and_Manaully_Cotrolled_Robot

Designing and Programming a robot that could navigate the three tasks. These tasks were 1) Controlling the robot using a joystick, 2) Autonomously driving along a path and 3) autonomously driving along a path. The final design chosen was one that used wheel mechanism (Wheels + gears + dowels). The final design also controls the car using a DC motor to run the car from the back wheels and a servo motor to turn the car left and right attached to the front wheels. The DC motor was operated at a 5V level, and the servo motor range used was 0 - 180 degrees.
